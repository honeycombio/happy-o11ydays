I
Among twenty snowy mountains,   
The only moving thing   
Was the eye of the blackbird.   
🐦
🎼II
I was of three minds,   
Like a tree   
In which there are three blackbirds.   
🐦🐦
🎼III
The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds.   
It was a small part of the pantomime.   
🐦🐦🐦
🎼IV
A man and a woman   
Are one.   
A man and a woman and a blackbird   
Are one.   
🐦🐦🐦🐦
🎼V
I do not know which to prefer,   
The beauty of inflections   
Or the beauty of innuendoes,   
The blackbird whistling   
Or just after.   
🐦
🎼VI
Icicles filled the long window   
With barbaric glass.   
The shadow of the blackbird   
Crossed it, to and fro.   
The mood   
Traced in the shadow   
An indecipherable cause.   
🐦
🎼VII
O thin men of Haddam,   
Why do you imagine golden birds?   
Do you not see how the blackbird   
Walks around the feet   
Of the women about you?   
🐦🐦🐦
🎼VIII
I know noble accents   
And lucid, inescapable rhythms;   
But I know, too,   
That the blackbird is involved   
In what I know.   
🐦
🎼IX
When the blackbird flew out of sight,   
It marked the edge   
Of one of many circles.   
🐦🐦
🎼X
At the sight of blackbirds   
Flying in a green light,   
Even the bawds of euphony   
Would cry out sharply.   
🐦🐦🐦🐦
🎼XI
He rode over Connecticut   
In a glass coach.   
Once, a fear pierced him,   
In that he mistook   
The shadow of his equipage   
For blackbirds.   
🐦🐦
🎼XII
The river is moving.   
The blackbird must be flying.   
🐦
🎼XIII
It was evening all afternoon.   
It was snowing   
And it was going to snow.   
The blackbird sat   
In the cedar-limbs.
