In August's glow,  
DevOpsDays show,  
Chicagoâ€™s the place,  
Techâ€™s fast-paced race.

ðŸŽ¼Startups take flight,  
Industry's might,  
From near and far,  
They raise the bar.

ðŸŽ¼Development, QA,  
Leaders pave the way,  
InfoSec, operations align,  
Together, they shine.

ðŸŽ¼Ninth year it stands,  
Across techâ€™s vast lands,  
Bigger, better, anew,  
Surprises not few.

ðŸŽ¼Mornings host talks,  
Ideas, no locks,  
Ignite sessions ignite,  
Quick, sharp, and light.

ðŸŽ¼Open Spaces call,  
Afternoon's free-for-all,  
Key moments, profound,  
Knowledge all around.

ðŸŽ¼Accessibility's creed,  
For every need,  
Captions make way,  
For all to sway.

ðŸŽ¼Questions? Just ask,  
For the conference's task,  
Email, reach out,  
Without a doubt.

ðŸŽ¼And let's not forget,  
The mascot you've met,  
With pride, they shout,  
DevOps Yakâ€™s about!
