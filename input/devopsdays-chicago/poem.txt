In the heart of the Midwest, where the tech scene grows,
Chicago’s been buzzing, as everybody knows.
From startups so new, to industry might,
The city's tech pulse is shining so bright.

Nine years and counting, the event’s been so grand,
DevOpsDays Chicago, best in the land.
Development, operations, leadership and more,
Come together to discuss, learn and explore.

In the morn, there’s a single track vibe,
30-minute talks, where insights derive.
Ignite sessions follow, quick and intense,
Five minutes of fire, no pretense.

The afternoon calls with Open Spaces' beat,
A key part of the event, where great minds meet.
Discussing the culture, tools of the trade,
Bettering products and progress made.

Accessibility’s key, for all to be part,
Captioned talks in the morning, a very smart start.
Venue's barrier-free, to keep all in the loop,
For any needs, just give the team a scoop.

So, if you're into DevOps, don’t sit in the back,
Come to Chicago, 'cause the DevOps Yak is Back!
Questions? Concerns? Drop a line, don’t delay,
At chicago@devopsdays.org, you'll find your way.
