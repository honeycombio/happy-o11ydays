In August's glow,  
DevOpsDays show,  
Chicago’s the place,  
Tech’s fast-paced race.

Startups take flight,  
Industry's might,  
From near and far,  
They raise the bar.

Development, QA,  
Leaders pave the way,  
InfoSec, operations align,  
Together, they shine.

Ninth year it stands,  
Across tech’s vast lands,  
Bigger, better, anew,  
Surprises not few.

Mornings host talks,  
Ideas, no locks,  
Ignite sessions ignite,  
Quick, sharp, and light.

Open Spaces call,  
Afternoon's free-for-all,  
Key moments, profound,  
Knowledge all around.

Accessibility's creed,  
For every need,  
Captions make way,  
For all to sway.

Questions? Just ask,  
For the conference's task,  
Email, reach out,  
Without a doubt.

And let's not forget,  
The mascot you've met,  
With pride, they shout,  
DevOps Yak’s about!
